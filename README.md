This extension allows creating public and private lists of discussions.

Public lists can further be configured as series which will be shown as a navigation menu on discussions and blog posts.

Private lists act as a bookmark feature and can be accessed from a user profile.

Lists can be ordered by date or manually.
Manually ordered lists are limited to 50 entries maximum, to avoid any issue related to pagination.

## Installation

This extension will automatically install [Flamarkt Backoffice](https://github.com/flamarkt/backoffice), which you will need to enable before you can enable this extension.
You don't need to worry about the backoffice admin panel, it's not used.
The backoffice is only installed to get access to some of its UI components.

    composer require clarkwinkelmann/flarum-ext-discussion-lists

## Support

This extension is under **minimal maintenance**.

It was developed for a client and released as open-source for the benefit of the community.
I might publish simple bugfixes or compatibility updates for free.

You can [contact me](https://clarkwinkelmann.com/flarum) to sponsor additional features or updates.

Support is offered on a "best effort" basis through the Flarum community thread.
